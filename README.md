# garage

raspberry pi code for monitoring and controlling my garage door.

## Future me

I used this to setup the wifi [link to wifi setup](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/setting-up-wifi-with-occidentalis)

The `package.json`and the `config.json` are just backups of the real things. They need to both be in the config folder but the docker image messes with that folder too much and I want to keep the ability to edit these from the web interface
